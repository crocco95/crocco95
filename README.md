# Hello World!
Hi, my name is **Lorenzo**, I am 25, Italian and I work as software developer specialized in web applications.
My favorite programming language is **PHP** that I use for nearly 10 years. I usually use it as "vanilla" flavor, Laravel, and Lumen frameworks. I have a little experience also with Symfony but I don't like it so much.

**Javascript** is obviously a language that I use massively in my projects and I love it as well, in particular when implemented using **Vue.JS**, my JS favorite framework.

I also enjoy developing mobile applications mainly using **Flutter**, a Dart framework that I really enjoy using and experiment with.

I usually develop microservice applications that run on **Kubernetes** or (AWS) **ECS** clusters.
I am not a system administrator but I have enough knowledge to setup my cloud architecture by myself and maintain and update that during the software lifetime (I love Linux systems).

I love cybersecurity and machine learning even I am not specialized in those branches, I hope to have the possibility to dedicate much more time to learn it more and more soon. 

Unfortunately, I don't produce many open-source projects due to the little time that I have at the time so my GitHub profile is not so interesting, I hope to do that in the next few years.
