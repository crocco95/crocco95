# Hello World!
Hi, my name is **Lorenzo**, I am a '95 Italian guy and I work as software developer specialized in web serverless backend applications.
I love develop backend infrastructures and I usually code using NodeJS & PHP as programming language and AWS as my cloud platform of choice.
Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Cloudformation and Cloudwatch are my most used AWS services.

I hope to publish more open source projects in the future ðŸ˜„

Cya!
